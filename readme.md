Blazing Fast JavaScript Course Project Template (PAUSIBER)
---

JavaScript is a scripting language that supports multiple programming styles. It differs from other languages such as C++, Java or PHP with its dynamic behaviour, its first-class functions and its prototype-based inheritance.

JavaScript lovers consider these features as the force of the language. It's very common for people who try to write JavaScript like they write code in other languages to hate it. *Don't make this mistake!*

* Dynamic
* Weakly typed
* Multi-paradigm
* Imperative
* Functional
* Object-oriented
* First-class functions
* Prototype-based
